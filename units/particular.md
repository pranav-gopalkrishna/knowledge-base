Note that to be is to be something in particular, i.e. to have an identity, and thus, to be distinct (i.e. unique) and delimited in attributes and actions. Thus, we see that any existent is something specific, and thus, a particular is ultimately "that which exists"; i.e. existence is ultimately made of particulars. The concept of "particular" serves to highlight these facts about things that exist.

## Particular as a quality
The distinctness and delimited nature of something.
