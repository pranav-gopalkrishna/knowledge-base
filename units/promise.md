# Promise
Declaration/assurance of a particular [future](./future.md) occurrence.

## Programming
**_An asynchronous programming concept_** (see [asynchrony](./asynchrony.md))

Object representing pending results of asynchronous operations.

---

Aligns with the broader idea of promise, as it:

- Does not actually contain any results in the present
- Assures the availability of results upon operation-completion

_It promises future results in the form of a present object._

Also called:

- [Future](./future.md)
- Delay
- Deferred
