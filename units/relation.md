# Relation
Identifying similarities/differences between 2 or more things.

**NOTE**: _Things can be abstract (e.g. ideas) or concrete._

Too reductive? Consider:

- A logical relationship identifies common/different:
    - Attributes (equivalence, subset, etc.)
    - Premises (implication, inference, etc.)
    - Sequences (ordering, progression, etc.)
- A causal relationship identifies common/different:
    - Points of contact (between entities)
    - Media of interaction (between entities)
    - Potentials (in a system of entities)

Now, note that:

- Law of identity (the fundamental law of reality) governs logic
- Law of causality is a fundamental implication of identity

Everything in reality:

- Has an identity (by the law of identity)
- Acts according to its identity (by the law of causality)

Thus, relationships are ultimately logical/causal relationships.

**NOTE**: _Identity is the fundamental relation._

Thus, the given definition of relationship is purposefully concise.

## Mathematics
Relation between 2 or more [set](./set.md)s/2 or more elements of sets.
