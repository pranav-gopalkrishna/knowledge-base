# Function
_As a noun_...

The natural/intended purpose of some(thing/one) within a context.

_As a verb_...

Purposefully performing/executing tasks.

## Mathematics
### Broad Definition
A [relation](./relation.md) mapping each input to only one output.

### Precise Definition
Note the following:

- The pool of possible inputs is the "domain"
- The pool of possible outputs is the "codomain"
- The pool defining the true scope of outputs is the "range"

The range is a subset of the codomain.

---

Let:

- A be the domain
- B be the codomain
- f be a relation

A function is a relation with the constraint that:

$f:A \rightarrow B$ assigns each element in $A$ to exactly one element in $B$.

### Connection to Broader Definition
Thus, a function generalises the idea of task-execution, since:

- Task-completion involves a well-defined end-state
- Task-execution involves converting A to B, where:
    - A is the initial state (constraints and inputs)
    - B is the final state (well-defined end-results)

## Programming
A function is procedure that:

- Takes zero or more inputs (arguments)
- Performs a specific task/set of tasks
- Returns zero or more outputs

_If a function involves_...

- Inputs + Outputs: _It implements a mathematical function_
- No Outputs: _It aligns with the broader idea of function_
